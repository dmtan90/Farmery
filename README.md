# Farmery â€” Opensource Cultivation Management Platform

## Overview of Farmery

Farmery is an open-source cultivation management system based on NodeJS, Vue.JS, and MongoDB. We started to develop it in November 2020, because we want to build an open-source cultivation management system for every farmer around the world can apply technology to improve their business, where we have to connect various sensors, smart devices, task management, and automation processes for farming and manage it while we are on the go.
If you are a farm owner, scientist, grower, or researcher, you can manage your farm easily with Farmery. We know that itâ€™s still a small project. Therefore, we are very open if you want to collaborate with us and make this project bigger. Contact us dmtan@agrhub.com
